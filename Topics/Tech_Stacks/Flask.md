# Flask

## Prerequisites

Prior to learning about Flask, you will need basic knowledge regarding the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a highly popular, high level general purpose programming language.
- [Web Frameworks](https://deepsource.io/glossary/web-framework/): Software frameworks/libraries that help developers write software that runs on the web.

## Introduction

Flask is an extremely popular micro web framework, that is written in Python. A micro framework is a framework that has a very low amount of dependencies, thus meaning that it is easy to use and maintain out of the box. However, this may mean that a developer must manually increase the list of dependencies if more features are desired. As a fully functional web framework, Flask provides developers the ability to create complete web applications. Flask is commonly compared to Django, which is also a Python web framework. In general, Flask is much better suited for smaller web applications with static pages, while Django should be more heavily considered for larger full stack projects. Overall, Flask is extremely easy to get started with, and should be your first choice if your main goal is to get a basic web application running
